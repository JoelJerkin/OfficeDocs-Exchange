# Exchange 2016 system requirements

 **Summary**: Learn about what you need to have in your environment before installing Exchange 2016.

> [!TIP]
> Coming from the Exchange Deployment Assistant? Click [Exchange 2013 system requirements](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/aa996719%28v=exchg.150%29.aspx).

Before you install Exchange 2016, we recommend that you review this topic to ensure that your network, hardware, software, clients, and other elements meet the requirements for Exchange 2016. In addition, make sure you understand the coexistence scenarios that are supported for Exchange 2016 and earlier versions of Exchange.

## Supported coexistence scenarios

The following table lists the scenarios in which coexistence between Exchange 2016 and earlier versions of Exchange is supported.

**Coexistence of Exchange 2016 with earlier versions of Exchange Server**

|**Exchange version**|**Exchange organization coexistence**|
|:-----|:-----|
|Exchange 2007 and earlier versions  <br/> |Not supported  <br/> |
|Exchange 2010  <br/> |Supported with Update Rollup 11 for Exchange 2010 SP3 or later on all Exchange 2010 servers in the organization, including Edge Transport servers.  <br/> |
|Exchange 2013  <br/> |Supported with Exchange 2013 Cumulative Update 10 or later on all Exchange 2013 servers in the organization, including Edge Transport servers.  <br/> |
|Mixed Exchange 2010 and Exchange 2013 organization  <br/> |Supported with the following minimum versions of Exchange:  <br/> Update Rollup 11 Exchange 2010 SP3 or later on all Exchange 2010 servers in the organization, including Edge Transport servers.  <br/> Exchange 2013 Cumulative Update 10 or later on all Exchange 2013 servers in the organization, including Edge Transport servers.  <br/> |
 
## Supported hybrid deployment scenarios

Exchange 2016 supports hybrid deployments with Office 365 tenants that have been upgraded to the latest version of Office 365. For more information about specific hybrid deployments, see [Hybrid Deployment Prerequisites](http://technet.microsoft.com/library/e7454db0-fed4-4662-8890-9501126b1ba2.aspx).

## Network and directory servers

The following table lists the requirements for the network and the directory servers in your Exchange 2016 organization.

 **Network and directory server requirements for Exchange 2016**

|**Component**|**Requirement**|
|:-----|:-----|
|Domain controllers  <br/> |All domain controllers in the forest need to be running one of the following:  <br/> Windows Server 2016 Standard or Datacenter  <br/> Windows Server 2012 R2 Standard or Datacenter  <br/> Windows Server 2012 Standard or Datacenter  <br/> Windows Server 2008 R2 Standard or Enterprise  <br/> Windows Server 2008 R2 Datacenter RTM or later  <br/> |
|Active Directory forest  <br/> |The Active Directory forest functionality level needs to be at Windows Server 2008 R2 or higher.  <br/> |
|DNS namespace support  <br/> |Exchange 2016 supports the following domain name system (DNS) namespaces:  <br/> • Contiguous  <br/> • Noncontiguous  <br/> • Single label domains  <br/> • Disjoint  <br/> For more information about DNS namespaces supported by Exchange, see Microsoft Knowledge Base article 2269838, [Microsoft Exchange compatibility with Single Label Domains, Disjoined Namespaces, and Discontiguous Namespaces](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=3052&kbid=2269838).  <br/> |
|IPv6 support  <br/> |In Exchange 2016, IPv6 is supported only when IPv4 is also installed and enabled. If Exchange 2016 is deployed in this configuration, and the network supports IPv4 and IPv6, all Exchange servers can send data to and receive data from devices, servers, and clients that use IPv6 addresses. For more information, see [IPv6 Support in Exchange 2013](http://technet.microsoft.com/library/33543023-eb9a-4102-b990-84a818a52814.aspx).  <br/> |
 
## Directory server architecture

The use of 64-bit Active Directory domain controllers increases directory service performance for Exchange 2016.

> [!NOTE]
> In multi-domain environments, on Windows Server 2008 domain controllers that have the Active Directory language locale set to Japanese (ja-jp), your servers may not receive some attributes that are stored on an object during inbound replication. For more information, see Microsoft Knowledge Base article 949189, [A Windows Server 2008 domain controller that is configured with the Japanese language locale may not apply updates to attributes on an object during inbound replication](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=3052&kbid=949189).

### Installing Exchange 2016 on directory servers

For security and performance reasons, we recommend that you install Exchange 2016 only on member servers and not on Active Directory directory servers. To learn about the issues you can face when installing Exchange 2016 on a directory server, see [Installing Exchange on a domain controller is not recommended [WarningInstallExchangeRolesOnDomainController]](deployment-ref/ms-exch-setupreadiness-warninginstallexchangerolesondomaincontroller.md)After Exchange 2016 is installed, changing its role from a member server to a directory server, or vice versa, isn't supported.

## Exchange 2016 third-party clients

Exchange Server offers several well-known protocols, and publishes APIs that third-party vendors often write clients for.

Microsoft makes no warranties, expressed or implied, as to the overall suitability, fitness, compatibility, or security of clients that are created by third-party developers.

If you want to use a third-party client that uses our protocols or APIs, we recommend that you thoroughly review and test all considerations (functionality, security, maintenance, management, and so on) before you deploy the client in the enterprise workspace. We also recommend that you make sure that the third-party vendor offers an appropriate Enterprise Support Agreement (ESA).
